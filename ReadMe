This is a simple rpg game made using Java. It is not complete and as such there are still 
parts that have not been implemented and there may still be bugs.

There are currently two enemies that can be encountered and fought. Each enemy has different stats and different loot tables.
There is a working inventory system for gaining items, equipping items, using items, and selling items.
There is a working stat system. Each time you level up, you gain a stat point that you can allocate to a few different stats.
There is currently one working city that you can discover, although not all of the options in the city have been implemented.
